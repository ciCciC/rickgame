# Rick Game
[2016]

### About this game
Rick is facing alien invaders and has to survive.

### Background story
The idea behind this project (in 2016) was to create a playground (game engine) in order to experiment with mathematics, physics and computer science. Over the years I have made minor adjustments such as uploading an image of Rick. The current state of the project presents enough challenges e.g. refactoring.
