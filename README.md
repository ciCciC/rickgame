# Rickgame
Rick is facing alien invaders and has to survive.

During my freshman year I started taking a deeper look in creating a game engine to develop 2D indie games. Over the years I have made minor adjustments such as uploading an image of Rick. 
The current state of the project presents me with enough challenges to refactor it. 

The idea behind this project was to create a playground for myself where you can experiment with mathematics, physics and computer science.
